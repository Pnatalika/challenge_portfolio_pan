# Task 1 Software configuration
## Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
### Hello, I`m Nataliia. I am very glad that I can participate in the challenge portfolio. I worked as a manual tester for a year and I want to move on. Test automation is an inevitable future that appeals to me greatly. 
### My goal is to develop my testing skills and change the direction from manual to automated. I also want to get the most out of this challenge and hope to get an internship at the company. I am sure that this challenge will not only be an interesting pastime, but also a chance to grow in my career and develop testing skills.
## Thanks!ðŸ˜Š
